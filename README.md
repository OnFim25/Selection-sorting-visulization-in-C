# Selection Sort Visualization â€“ C Terminal Edition

This project is a terminal-based visualization of the **Selection Sort** algorithm, implemented in C.  
It generates a random array of values and displays them as an ASCII-based bar graph in the terminal, updating the display step-by-step as the algorithm runs.

## Features
- **Randomized input**: Generates a new random array for each run.
- **Visual sorting**: Displays the array as horizontal/vertical ASCII bars.
- **Step-by-step animation**: The array is updated every second, showing the selection sort process in real time.
- **Fully functional**: Runs correctly and produces clear visual output.
- **No external libraries**: Implemented using only standard C and terminal output.

## Purpose
This was created as a hobby project to:
- Practice implementing sorting algorithms in C.
- Explore creative visualization methods in a text-only terminal environment.
- Gain deeper understanding of the selection sort process.

## How It Works
1. The program generates a random array of values.
2. Displays the array as ASCII bars in the terminal.
3. On each step (1-second interval), the algorithm selects the smallest remaining value and swaps it into place.
4. Visualization updates until the array is sorted.

## Status
- Completed and functional (created in 2023).
- Archived here as part of my personal programming portfolio.
